- Melee attack system in 3 directions (up, down, side)
- Basic experience and leveling system
- Health bar, experience bar, and level display
- Temporary invincibility frames (i-frames) after taking damage
- Wave-based enemy spawner
- Boss spawn at the final wave
- Pause menu and Skill Tree panel (skill logic not yet fully implemented)
- Game Over and Victory screens
- Basic sound effects
